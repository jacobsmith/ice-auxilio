ICE Auxilio README
===

This app is a reference app for people going through immigration proceedings.

It is built on top of React Native utilizing the [Expo](https://expo.io) platform in order to deliver new content quickly and easily to individuals.

Functionality
===
Currently, the app walks users through what to do in the event ICE and/or police arrive at their home. Users answer a series of yes or no questions that help guide the legal actions they can take (such as refusing entry without proper warrants, etc.).

Personal Note
===

This app came about because I am appalled by the conditions immigrants are facing, especially in the current political climate. As a programmer, I have felt rather useless since I don't have direct legal knowledge to help individuals. Besides contacting my representatives, this was the next best thing I could think of. I encourage any and all pull requests to enhance the application and help connect individuals with organizations providing additional resources. It is a very quick and "dirty" app from a programming point of view - having something out and working on people's phones is more important than perfecting the code, especially in an area like this where time is of the essence.

Code of Conduct
===

All individuals who wish to contribute code to this repository or engage with its community in any way:

1. Affirm that all people have value as human beings, regardless of immigration status.
2. Will be constructive in helping individuals navigate the US legal system via this app.
